# ChatGPT with HoustonAI

This is a minimal web UI for OpenAI API, featuring the HoustonAI interface. Powered by Astro and OpenAI API.

You can deploy a ChatGPT chat page with the HoustonAI interface using your OpenAI API Key.

**Note:** This project is for personal, **NON-COMMERCIAL** purposes and is **NOT an OFFICIAL project of the Astro team.**

## Status

This repo is inspired by [anse-app/chatgpt-demo](https://github.com/anse-app/chatgpt-demo), based on [withastro/houston.astro.build](https://github.com/withastro/houston.astro.build). Modifications have been made to the code in `src/components/Generator.astro`, `src/util.ts` and `src/pages/api.ts` to enable communication with the OpenAI API within the HoustonAI interface.

Currently, the project does not support custom features such as `System Role` and `Temperature`, but plans to implement these in the future.

**Code in this repo is messy! Our goal is to clean this up and share it as an Astro template example.**
